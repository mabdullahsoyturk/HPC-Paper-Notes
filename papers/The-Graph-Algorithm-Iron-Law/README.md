## Notes:

* Algorithm is the most important factor for performance.
* The memory bottleneck is due to **memory latency** much more often than it is due to **memory bandwidth** because memory bandwidth is typically underutilized.
* Improving cache hit rates results in memory bandwidth becoming further underutilized.
* The most important architectural features affecting graph processing execution are **cache effectiveness** and **memory bandwidth utilization**.

Three characteristics that are most relevant for graph algorithm performance:
1. Algorithm Efficiency (Number of traversed edges ~ First Term in the formula)
2. Cache Effectiveness (Number of memory requests per traversed edge ~ Second Term in the formula)
3. Memory Bandwidth Utilization (Inverse bandwidth ~ Third Term in the formula)

* Unused prefetches will consume memory bandwidth, but a reasonably designed system will give cache misses priority over the hardware prefetcher.
