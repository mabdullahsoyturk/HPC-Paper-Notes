## What
Framework to generate highly optimized stencil code.

## Why
There are many optimizations that can be done and it is hard to do them manually.

## How
They take expressions written in Python and lower them to C++ code through a series of intermadiate representations.

## Notes

* It uses SymPy for the specification and manipulation of stencil expressions.
