# Analysis and Optimization of the Memory Hierarchy for Graph Processing Workloads
Reference: A. Basak et al., "Analysis and Optimization of the Memory Hierarchy for Graph Processing Workloads," 2019 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), Washington, DC, USA, 2019, pp. 373-386, doi: 10.1109/HPCA.2019.00051.

## Notes:

* This paper claims that main bottleneck is load-load dependency chains, in contrast to locality paper (this one says the main bottleneck is instruction window size).
